# ICPC_Solutions
This Repository contains my solution for ICPC Quantum Challenge
For The First Problem I have tried to lower the Cost and was able to get 

Ex1a - 8

Ex1b - 20

Ex1c - 28

For The Second Problem I have tried to use the counter but that was very highly costly. So I redesigned the circuit and tried to lower the cost. Later After the Challenge got over I realized That Using the QFT adder Approach would drastically reduce the cost. 

My solution cost at the time of challenge is 

Ex2a - 241

Ex2b - 1265

For the Third Problem I have tried to Reduce the cost when I have completed. I know this can also be reduced further but I have't tried that. 

Ex3 - 331 

For the Score and rank.

As My Ex2b cost is too high so my rank is not as good as it should be.

Rank - 29 

Score -382.7/600
